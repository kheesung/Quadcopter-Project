# Quadcopter-Project

## Introduction: 

This project is to build a quadcopter that can track human movement and follow
through the movement. We are currently using Intel Edison Breakout Board as our 
microcontroller.

## Goal:

1. To build a quadcopter that can automatically balance itself in a given height
2. To establish a wireless connection to the quadcopter
3. To code for a human movement recognition, and to trace the movement
4. To control the movement of the quadcopter in real-time
5. To allow quadcopter to follow the path given by GPS

## Components Used: 

1. Intel Edison Breakout Board

## Update on 27th July

#### What we did:

* Decided to use Intel Edison instead of MSP430 since 16 bit is too slow
* Created repositories in GitHub
* Discussed on the goals of the quadcopter

#### Things needed:

* Need to connect Intel Edison to computer
* Build connection from the microcontroller to the quadcopter
